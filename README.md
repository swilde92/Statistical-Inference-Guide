# Statistical-Inference-Guide

https://swilde92.github.io/Statistical-Inference-Guide/

This is an r markdown document that gives an overview of approaches to statistical inference analyses. 

This will not cover basic statistical inference or testing, but assuming you have a simple foundation in statistical inference, this guide
should help organize some more advanced information about it. Given an open ended assignment that should use statistical inference, this 
guide can be used for the purpose of helping you get started in knowing what approach is appropriate.
